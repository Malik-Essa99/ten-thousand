I would like to make a ten-thousand terminal game using python, using Gamelogic class 

+ class GameLogic:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize game state variables

    def roll_dice(self):
        # Implement dice rolling logic

    def calculate_score(self, dice):
        # Implement scoring logic

    def update_player_score(self, player, score):
        # Update player score

    def is_game_over(self):
        # Check if the game is over

    # Add other necessary methods and properties

GameLogic.roll_dice() missing 1 required positional argument: 'num'
+ import random

class GameLogic:
    def roll_dice(self, num=6):
        result = ()
        for _ in range(num):
            result += (random.randint(1, 6),)
        return result

now implement Three Pairs in addition to single 1 and 5
+ class GameLogic:
    @staticmethod
    def calculate_score(dice):
        score = 0
        counts = [0] * 6  # Initialize counts for each dice value

        for value in dice:
            counts[value - 1] += 1  # Increment the count for the corresponding dice value

        # Scoring for single 1 and 5
        score += counts[0] * 100  # Each 1 is worth 100 points
        score += counts[4] * 50  # Each 5 is worth 50 points

        # Scoring for Three Pairs
        if all(count == 2 for count in counts):
            score += 1500

        return score

now implement 3 of a kind, 4 of a kind 5 of a kind and 6 of a kind

@staticmethod
    def calculate_score(dice):
        score = 0
        counts = [0] * 6  # Initialize counts for each dice value

        for value in dice:
            counts[value - 1] += 1  # Increment the count for the corresponding dice value

        # Scoring for single 1 and 5
        score += counts[0] * 100  # Each 1 is worth 100 points
        score += counts[4] * 50  # Each 5 is worth 50 points

        # Scoring for Three of a Kind
        for i in range(6):
            if counts[i] >= 3:
                score += (i + 1) * 100

        # Scoring for Four of a Kind
        for i in range(6):
            if counts[i] >= 4:
                score += (i + 1) * 200

        # Scoring for Five of a Kind
        for i in range(6):
            if counts[i] == 5:
                score += (i + 1) * 300

        # Scoring for Six of a Kind
        for i in range(6):
            if counts[i] == 6:
                score += (i + 1) * 400

        return score
